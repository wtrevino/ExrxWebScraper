Title: Dumbbell Hammer Curl
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: Brachioradialis

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Position two dumbbells to sides, palms facing in, arms straight.
      Execution

      With elbows to sides, raise one dumbbell until forearm is
        vertical and thumb faces shoulder. Lower to original position
        and repeat with alternative arm.
      Comments

      The biceps may be exercised alternating (as described), simultaneous,
        or in simultaneous-alternating fashion. When elbows are fully
        flexed, they can travel forward slightly allowing forearms to
        be no more than vertical. This additional movement allows for
        relative release of tension in muscles between repetitions.

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Hold barbell down in front, arms straight with shoulder width
        or slightly wider overhand grip. Stand with feet together. Lift
        leg slightly so foot is just off floor.
      Execution

      Lower bar to floor while raising lifted leg back behind.
        Keep back straight and knee of supporting leg slightly bend.
        Keep hip and knee of lifted leg extended throughout movement.
        Once stretch is felt or barbell contacts floor, return to original
        position by raising torso while lowering lifted leg. Straighten
        knee of supporting leg as torso becomes upright. Repeat.
      Comments

      Throughout lift keep arms and back straight. Do not lower
        weight beyond mild stretch throughout hamstrings. Full range
        of motion will vary from person to person. Those with less
        flexibility may need to bend knee of supporting leg more
        so barbell can contact floor. At top of movement, lifted foot
        can make contact with floor to maintain balance between repetitions.

      Comments

      Since this movement becomes more difficult as full shoulder
        elevation is achieved, height criteria for shoulder elevation
        may be needed. For example, raising shoulders until slope of
        shoulders become horizontal may be considered adequate depending
        upon individual body structure and range of motion with lighter
        weight. Also see ROM

Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: Hamstrings

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Place platform to one side of padded lever. Have additional
        padded board in hand. Facing machine, stand to one side of padded
        roller. Place far leg on elevated platform. Position closest
        leg into apparatus by placing back of lower leg against lever
        roller. Place extra padded board between knee and edge of seat.
        Position knee forward securely against padded board and edge
        of seat. Bend over seat by bending hips and support torso with
        arms.
      Execution

      Pull lever to back of thigh by flexing knee. Return lever
        until knee is straight. Repeat. Continue with opposite leg.
      Comments

      A leg extension with padded rollers with access to both sides
        is required. If needed, raise body slightly by raising heel so
        lever fulcrum closer to knee articulation. Disregard calf as
        stabilizer if this is not necessary. Dorsal
        flexion of ankle reduces active
        insufficiency of Gastrocnemius allowing it to assist in knee
        flexion.

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Facing bench, stand between bench and lever pads. Lie prone
        on bench with knees just beyond edge of bench and lower legs
        under lever pads. Grasp handles.
      Execution

      Raise one lever pad to back of thigh by flexing knee. Lower
        lever pad until knee is straight. Raise and lower other leg pad.
        Continue by alternating legs.
      Comments

      Keep torso on bench to reduce hyperextension of lower back.
        Most machines are angled at users hip to position hamstring in
        more favorable mechanical position. If angle at hip is significantly
        bent, Rectus Femoris will less likely be involved as Antagonist
        Stabilizer. Dorsal
        flexion of ankle reduces active
        insufficiency of Gastrocnemius allowing it to assist in knee
        flexion. See Knee

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Sit on mat with legs together. Place hands back to sides
        on floor or mat so torso is reclined back slightly.
      Execution

      Raise hips up off floor until hips are straight. Hold position.
      Comments

      Muscles are exercised isometrically.
      Easier

      Movement can be made easier placing hands back onto sturdy
        elevated structure and performing movement. Movement can also
        be performed on forearms with arms bent.
      Harder

      Exercise could be made more challenging with added weight
        (eg: sandbags, partner) on hips or upper thighs although it is
        rarely performed in that manner. Raising one foot up off floor
        can also make holding this position more difficult.

    Preparation

    Position shoulders under shoulder pads with back against
      back pad. Place one foot slightly forward on platform. Place
      other foot against rear vertical platform. Squeeze hand lever.
      Keeping hand lever squeezed, squat down by bending hips and knees
      until hip or knee is short of complete flexion. Release hand
      lever and raise up on sled just slightly until weight stack is
      engaged (click is heard).
    Execution

    Raise lever by extending knees and hips. Lower lever by flexing
      hips and knees until knee of rear leg is almost in contact with
      floor. Repeat. Continue with opposite leg positions.
    Comments

    Squeeze hand lever at bottom of movement to disengage weight
      stack. Keep hand lever squeezed until sled is raised and legs

Title: Lever Split V-Squat
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: Quadriceps

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Position shoulders under shoulder pads with back against
        back pad. Place feet on platform shoulder or hip width apart,
        slightly back. Squeeze hand lever. Keeping hand lever squeezed,
        squat down by bending hips and knees until knees or hips are
        just short of complete flexion. Release hand lever and raise
        up on sled just slightly until weight stack is engaged (click
        is heard). Raise sled by extending knees and hips until legs
        are straight. Place one leg back behind plateform with toes pointed
        downward over floor.
      Execution

      Squat down with knee pointed same direction as foot. Allow
        leg to bend behind with forefoot on floor. Descend until forward
        hip is near complete flexion. Raise sled by extending knee and
        hip until leg is straight. Repeat. Continue with opposite leg.
      Comments

      Squeeze hand lever at bottom of movement to disengage weight
        stack. Keep hand lever squeezed until sled is raised and leg
        is straight. If insufficient hip flexibility forces pelvis to
        pull away from back pad at lower portions of movement, only lower
        sled just short of spinal articulation. Keep knee pointed same
        directions as foot. Do not allow heel to raise off of platform,
        pushing with both heel and forefoot. Placing feet slightly forward
        on platform emphasize Gluteus Maximus. Placing feet slightly
        back on platform emphasize Quadriceps. See manufucture's suggested
        foot placement for Lever
        Split V-Squat.

Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: ErectorSpinae

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Position thighs prone on padding. Hook heels on platform
        lip or under padded brace. Hold weight to chest or behind neck.
      Execution

      Lower body by bending waist until fully flexed. Raise, or
        extend waist until torso is parallel to legs. Repeat.
      Comments

      Position pad high enough to evenly distribute body weight
        on thigh but not so high that range of motion is limited; abdomen
        should not press on top side of pad when upper body is lowered.
        Begin with body weight and add additional weight gradually to
        allow lower back adequate adaptation.
        Do not pause or bounce at bottom of lift. Do not lower weight
        beyond mild stretch throughout hamstrings and low back. Full
        range of motion will vary from person to person. Certain individuals
        may need to keep their neck in neutral position with space between
        their chin and sternum. See Arm
        Position During Waist Exercises. Although articulation of
        waist is emphasized, some hip extension may accommodate movement.

      Comments

      Those with limited
        hip flexor flexibility may need to stop before full exension
        on this particular type of apparatus (fulcrum near hip). Full
        range of motion will vary from person to person. Many machines
        may not sufficiently stabilize hips or their fulcrum may be near
        hip's axis. In which case, synergists muscles become primary
        movers and erector spinae becomes stabilizer (Graves JE, et.
        al. 1994). See alternative back extension machines (Nautilus
        and MedX) with hip stabilization.

      Preparation

      With feet strapped to power wheel kneel on floor.
        Place hands shoulder width apart on floor. With arms vertical
        and straight support body off of floor while rolling power
        wheel back until body is straight.
      Execution

      Raise rear end up as high as possible by bending hips. Pull
        power wheel toward hands while keeping knees straight. Return
        by extending hips to original position. Repeat.
      Comments

      Keep arms straight with shoulders positioned above hands.
        Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only contract
        dynamically if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist
        flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique act only to stabilize
        pelvis and waist during hip flexion. If waist flexion were to
        occur after complete hip flexion, resistive forces are no longer
        working against abdominal muscles in this final position when
        knees and hips are flexed. However, abdominal muscles are activated
        isometrically to keep spine straight when knees are not under
        body. Also see Spot
        Reduction Myth and Lower

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Sit on chair or bench with lower leg secured under low over
        hang or heavy bar. Place hands on waist, chest, neck, or head
        depending upon desired difficulty.
      Execution

      Lower body back until hips are almost extended. Raise body
        by flexing hips until torso is upright. Repeat.
      Comments

      Feet must be propped securely to prevent injury. Exercise
        can also be performed on Roman
        Chair Sit-up apparatus. Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only
        contract
        dynamically if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist
        flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only act
        to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. See Spot
        Reduction Myth and Lower
        Ab Myth. Also see Dangerous
        Exercise Essay.
      Easier

      Movement can be made easier by placing arms further down

Title: Vertical Leg Raise (on parallel bars)
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: HipFlexors

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Stand between parallel bars and grip bar on each side with
        overhand grip. Lift body off floor and balance body upright with
        arms straight.
      Execution

      Raise legs by flexing hips and knees until hips are completely
        flexed. Return until hips and knees are extended. Repeat.
      Comments

      This exercise is alternative to Vertical
        Leg Raise when apparatus is not available, or Hanging
        Leg Raise when high bar is not available or too low to allow
        for adequate leg clearance. Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only
        contract
        dynamically if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist
        flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only act
        to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. It may be necessary
        to completely flex hips before waist flexion is possible; see
        Weighted
        Vertical Leg-Hip Raise on parallel bars. Also see Spot
        Reduction Myth and Lower
        Ab Myth.
      Easier

      Lie on flat surface or incline to make this exercise less
        intense.
      Incline Leg Raise
      Harder

      Exercise can be performed with added weight. Knees may be
        kept extended throughout leg raise to increase intensity. Knees
        can also be raise to shoulders to dynamically involve Rectus
        Abdominis.

Title: Seated Leg Raise
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: HipFlexors

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Sit on edge of bench with legs extended to floor. Place weight
        between ankles or use no weight. Grasp edge of bench. Lean torso
        back and balance body weight on edge of bench.
      Execution

      Raise legs by flexing hips and knees while pulling torso
        slightly forward to maintain balance. Return by extending hips
        and knees and lean torso back to counter balance. Repeat.
      Comments

      Heels may make contact with floor to maintain balance at
        bottom of movement. Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only contract
        dynamically if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist
        flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only act
        to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. It may be necessary
        to completely flex hips before waist flexion is possible. Typically
        the spine is not extended enough in this movement to constitute
        significant spinal flexion so it remains classified as a hip
        flexor movement. Also see Spot

Title: Lying Simultaneous Alternating Straight Leg Raise
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: HipFlexors

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Lie supine on bench or mat. Place hands under lower buttock
        on each side to support pelvis. Raise one leg up vertical with
        knee nearly straight. If lying on floor, raise other leg slightly
        off of floor.
      Execution

      Keeping knees nearly straight, simultanously change positions
        of legs so vertical leg is lowered while lower leg is raised
        vertically. Continue alternating leg positions.
      Comments

      Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only contract
        dynamically if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist
        flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only act
        to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. It may be necessary
        to completely flex hips before waist flexion is possible. Conversely,
        it may be necessary to completely flex hips before waist flexion
        is possible which is not practical with alternating leg movements.
        Also see Spot
        Reduction Myth and Lower
        Ab Myth.
      Easier

      To decrease intensity, flex knees along with hips. Alternatively,
        perform exercise on floor and allow alternating heels to make
        contact with floor each repetition.
      Lying Simultaneous Alternating
        Leg Raise (knees bend)
      Harder

      To increase resistance use ankle weights or perform on incline
        board. Raising legs up only short height challenges greater isometric-like
        endurance.

      Preparation

      Lie supine on bench or mat. Place hands under lower buttock
        on each side to support pelvis.
      Execution

      Keeping knees straight, raise legs by flexing hips until
        hips are completely flexed. Return until hips and knees are extended.
        Repeat.
      Comments

      Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only contract

        to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. It may be necessary
        to completely flex hips before waist flexion is possible, as
        in leg-hip raise. Attempting to perform Lying Straight Leg Hip
        Raise would not load waist and hip flexors after they travel
        beyond vertical so that sort of movement would need to be performed
        on steep incline or vertical position, requiring much greater
        strength. Also see Spot

      Unless ankle weights are used, weighted version of this movement
        is not recommended due to potentially venerable position if dummbell
        accidentally slips from feet. To increase resistance, perform
        on incline board. Knees can also be raise to shoulders to dynamically

Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: Quadriceps

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Place bench behind smith bar. With bar upper chest height,
        position bar on back of shoulders and grasp bar to sides. Place
        foot slightly forward under bar. Extend other leg back and place
        top of foot on bench. Disengage bar by rotating bar back.
      Execution

      Lower body on leg by flexing knee and hip of front leg until
        knee of rear leg is almost in contact with floor. Return to original
        standing position by extending hip and knee of forward leg. Repeat.
        Continue with opposite leg.
      Comments

      Keep torso upright during squat; flexible
        hip flexors are important. Position foot very slightly forward
        to keep equal distribution of force on hip and knee extensors.
        Keep foot flat on floor. Forward knee should point same direction
        as foot throughout movement. May also be referred to as Lever
        Barbell Bulgarian Squat.

Title: Barbell 45-degree Back Extension (on hyperextension apparatus)
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: ErectorSpinae

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Position thighs prone on padding. Hook heels on platform
        lip or under padded brace. Place barbell on back of shoulders
        and grasp bar to sides.
      Execution

      Lower body by bending waist until fully flexed. Raise, or
        extend waist until torso is parallel to legs. Repeat.
      Comments

      Position pad high enough to evenly distribute body weight
        on thigh but not so high that range of motion is limited; abdomen
        should not press on top side of pad when upper body is lowered.
        Begin with body weight and add additional weight gradually to
        allow lower back adequate adaptation.
        Maintain barbell's position on back of shoulders when upper body
        is lowered. Do not pause or bounce at bottom of lift. Do not
        lower weight beyond mild stretch throughout hamstrings and low
        back. Full range of motion will vary from person to person. Although
        articulation of waist is emphasized, some hip extension may accommodate
        movement. Also see Barbell

Title: Twisting Crunch (on stability ball)
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: Obliques

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Sit on exercise ball. Walk forward on ball and lie back on
        ball with shoulders and head hanging off and knees and hips bent.
        Gently hyperextend back to contour of ball. Hold plate behind
        neck or on chest with both hands or use no weight.
      Execution

      Flex waist to raise upper torso. Return to original position.
        Repeat.
      Comments

      Certain individuals may need to keep their neck in neutral
        position with space between their chin and sternum. Some individuals
        may experience low back discomfort if hips are not bent so they
        must use smaller ball
        size or lower their hip position on ball. Also Spot

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Sit on incline board. Lie supine on incline board with torso
        elevated. Grasp feet rollers or sides of board for support.
      Execution

      With knees straight, raise legs by flexing hips until hips
        are completely flexed. Return until hips and knees are extended.
        Repeat.
      Comments

      Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only contract
        dynamically if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist
        flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only act
        to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. It may be necessary
        to completely flex hips before waist flexion is possible, as
        in leg-hip raise. Attempting to perform Incline Straight Leg-Hip
        Raise at a low incline would not load waist and hip flexors after
        they travel beyond vertical so that sort of movement would need
        to be performed on steep incline or vertical position, requiring
        much greater strength. Also see Spot

        flexed or knees are well above hips. Return until hips and knees
        are extended downward. Repeat.
      Comments

      Exercise can be performed without ab straps, by hanging
        from high bar. Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only contract
        dynamically if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist
        flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only act
        to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. It may be necessary
        to completely flex hips before waist flexion is possible, as
        in leg-hip raise. Also see Spot

Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: HipFlexors

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Place weight between ankles. Stand between parallel bars
        and grip bar on each side with overhand grip. Lift body off floor
        and balance body upright with arms straight.
      Execution

      Raise legs by flexing hips and knees until thighs are just
        pass parallel to floor. Return until hips and knees are extended.
        Repeat.
      Comments

      This exercise is alternative to Vertical
        Leg Raise when apparatus is not available, or Hanging
        Leg Raise when high bar is not available or too low to allow
        for adequate leg clearance. Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only
        contract
        dynamically if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist
        flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only act
        to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. It may be necessary
        to completely flex hips before waist flexion is possible; see
        Weighted
        Vertical Leg-Hip Raise on parallel bars. Exercise can be
        performed without added weight until more resistance is needed
        (See Vertical Leg Raise on
        dip bar). Knees may be kept extended throughout leg raise
        to increase intensity. Also see Spot

        dynamically if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist
        flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only act
        to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. Exercise may
        be performed with ab
        straps. It may be necessary to completely flex hips before
        waist flexion is possible; see Weighted
        Hanging Leg-Hip Raise. Exercise can be performed without
        added weight until more resistance is needed. Knees may be kept
        extended throughout leg raise to increase intensity; see Weighted Hanging Straight
        Leg Raise. Also see Spot
        Reduction Myth and Lower
        Ab Myth.

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Grasp handles slightly to front and stand on foot bar with
        knees slightly bent and hips against pad.
      Execution

      With back straight, raise legs as high as possible by flexing
        hips. Return and repeat.
      Comments

      Exercise is typically performed without added resistance.
        Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only contract
        dynamically if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist
        flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only act
        to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. It is necessary
        to raise legs higher than what is shown before waist flexion
        occurs; see Lever

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Stand on platform facing to one side and grasp bar for support.
        Position front of leg nearest machine against padded roller while
        standing on other leg.
      Execution

      Raise lever by flexing hip until knee is higher than hip.
        Return until hip is extended. Repeat. Continue with opposite
        leg.
      Comments

      Machine must be adjusted to align hip with lever fulcrum.
        Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only contract
        dynamically if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist
        flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only act

Title: Barbell Hack Squat
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: Quadriceps

Instructions:

    
    
    

    Instructions

    Preparation

    Position barbell just behind legs. With feet flat on floor,
      squat down and grasp barbell from behind with overhand grip.
    Execution

    Lift bar by extending hips and knees to full extension. Squat
      down by bending hips back while allowing knees to bend forward,
      keeping back straight and knees pointed same direction as feet.
      Descend until thighs are close to parallel to floor and bar is
      behind lower leg. Repeat.
    Comments

    Throughout lift keep hips low, shoulders high, arms and back
      straight. Knees should point same direction as feet throughout
      movement. See flawed
      demonstration showing depth of hack squat that is NOT sufficient
      and knees are NOT pointed same angle as feet. Individuals with
      short arm to torso ratio or protracted
      shoulder posture, may find this exercise very difficult to
      perform. See Squat Analysis.

      Exercise can be performed without
        added weight until more resistance is needed. Movement can
        be can also be made easier by positioning hip low on ball. In
        contrast, exercise can be made more challenging by positioning
        hip highr on ball. In which case, feet may be placed against
        base of wall for stability. See alternative

        on mat. Grasp handles on wheel to each side with overhand grip.
        Position wheel near front of knees and lean over wheel with arms
        extended downward, supporting upper body.
      Execution

      With arms straight, roll wheel out as far as possible. Lower
        body gently to floor extending arms forward. Raise body back
        up by flexing hips and pulling arms back to original position.
        Return until hips are extended. Repeat.
      Comments

      Keep elbows straight or nearly straight throughout exercise.
        Exercise can be performed without

      leg so legs are parallel. Place forearm on mat or floor under
      shoulder perpendicular to body.
    Execution

    Raise hips upward by lateral
      flexion of spine. Lower to original position and repeat.
      Reposition on opposite side and continue.
    Comments

    In addition to lateral flexion of spine, lower
      hip abducts and upper hip
      adducts. More popular suspension trainers allow limited slippage,
      so loop around lower leg can be positioned below loop of upper
      leg once on side (as shown). Other models can be adjusted, so
      strap on lower leg is slightly longer than strap on upper leg.
      Also see Spot
      Reduction Myth.
    Easier

    Exercise can be performed with bent knees. Movement can also
      be made easier angling body up against wall, horizontal bar or
      platform.

    Harder

    Exercise can be made more challenging with added weight on
      hip.

Title: Suspended Side Bend
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: Obliques

Instructions:

    
    
    

    Instructions

    Preparation

    Grasp handles, step away, and face body to one side of suspension
      trainer anchor. Hold handles above head with arms bent. Stand
      far enough away to make suspension trainer straps taut. Step
      in just enough to achieve desired lean of body, while keeping
      tension on suspension trainer straps.
    Execution

    Lower hips away from direction of suspension trainer anchor
      by laterally flexing spine. Return to original upright position
      and repeat. Reposition body facing opposite direction. Continue
      with other side.
    Comments

    Suspension handle(s) can also be gripped with both hands
      together with either one hand over other hand or with interlaced
      fingers. In addition to lateral
      flexion of spine, lower
      hip abducts and upper hip
      adducts. Also see Spot
      Reduction Myth.
    Easier

    Resistance is least when body is positioned upright at top
      of exercise.
    Harder

    This movement can be made more challenging by placing feet
      toward suspension trainer anchor, thereby leaning body more to
      one side. See Gravity
      Vectors for greater understanding of how body angle influences
      resistance.

    Instructions

    Preparation

    Place forearm on padded elevated surface, positioned perpendicular
      to body. Position feet out away from elevated surface, one foot
      in front of other with hips and knees straight. Place free hand
      on upper hip and allow lower hip and waist to bend downward
    Execution

    Raise hips upward by lateral
      flexion of spine. Lower to original position and repeat.
      Repeat with opposite side.
    Comments

    One of very few body weight exercises that directly exercises
      side deltoid in relatively full range of motion. In
      addition to lateral flexion of spine, lower
      hip abducts and upper hip
      adducts.See Spot
      Reduction Myth.
    Easier

    Movement can be made easier by positioning forearm on higher
      elevated surface.
    Harder

    Exercise can be made more challenging by propping forearm
      on lower height surface. Exercise is hardest when performed off
      of floor.

        bench near bar. Sit on bench facing bar and place toes on lower
        portion of platform with heels extending off. Grasp bar to sides
        and extend ankles to raise knees so lower thighs are under padded
        bar. Push heels further up. Disengage bar by rotating bar back.
      Execution

      Lower heels by bending ankles until calves are stretched.
        Raise heels by extending ankles as high as possible. Repeat.
      Comments

      Safety stops can be used to support bar at lowest position,
        particularly if it is difficult to rack bar to original height.
        If possible, adjust height of bench or calf block so thigh is
        close to horizontal. Movement is predominately Soleus. Gastrocnemius
        are in active
        insufficiency since knees are significantly bent.

Title: Lever Alternating Bent-knee Seated Calf Extension
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: Soleus

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Sit on seat and position forefeet on pedals. Grasp handles
        to sides and extend knees but maintain small bend in knees.
      Execution

      Push left pedal by extending ankle knee Simultaneously allow
        right pedal to return back by relaxing ankle and bending knee
        more. Reverse motion by pushing right pedal and allowing left
        pedal to return back by same means. Continue to alternate motion.
      Comments

      Position seat to allow full range of motion. Gastrocnemius
        act as dynamic stabilizers because when they 'contract' at ankle
        they are simultaneously 'stretched' at knee. It could be argued
        they also act as synergist since bend at knee could be considered
        relatively smaller range of motion as compared to ankle articulation
        resulting in net contraction of Gastrocnemius. Also see Lever
        Alternating Seated Calf Extension with straight.

Title: Suspended Hip Bridge
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: GluteusMaximus

Instructions:

    
    
    

    Instructions

    Preparation

    Sit on floor facing suspension trainer loops in low position.
      Grasp bottom of loops, then lay supine. Raise legs and place
      heels in loops with soles contacting handles. Lie down supine
      on mat so knees and hips are bent with suspension straps hanging
      vertical. Place arms off to sides.
    Execution

    Raise hips up by extending hips until fully extended. Lower
      hips until hips and back make contact with mat. Repeat.
    Comments

    Hamstring enters active
      insufficiency as hip is raised since knee is flexed and hip
      does not flex beyond 90 degrees. However it is used more to stabilize
      knees in fixed flexed position. Dorsal
      flexion of ankle reduces active
      insufficiency of Gastrocnemius allowing it to assist Hamstrings
      in maintaining fixed knee flexion. See Knee
      flexion abduction force vector diagram. Adductor
      Magnus does not assist since hip extension since hip extension
      does not occur in fully flexed position.
    Easier

    Movement can be made easier by lying closer under anchor
      of suspension trainer.
    Harder

    Movement can be made more challenging by lying further back,
      away horizontally from anchor of suspension trainer.

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Stand facing balance board. Step on one end of board. Slowly
        step on other end of board. Balance body weight on top of balance
        board so board is nearly vertical with little movement. See Balance Board Stand.
      Execution

      Extend arms forward in front of body. Squat down by bending
        knees forward slightly while allowing hips to bend back behind,
        keeping back straight and knees pointed same direction as feet.
        Descend until thighs are just past parallel to floor. Squat up
        by extending knees and hips until legs are straight. Return and
        repeat.
      Comments

      Use upper arm movement to assist with balance. Keep back
        straight, chest high, and feet flat on surface; equal distribution
        of weight through forefoot and heel. Knees should point same
        direction as feet throughout movement. When finished shift weight
        to one side. Step off with highest foot first.

Title: Cable Twist (up down)
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: Obliques

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Grasp stirrup from shoulder height cable pulley. Turn to
        one side away from pulley until near arm is extended straight.
        Position feet wide apart with furthest foot away from pulley
        and nearest foot close to pulley. Point both feet away from pulley.
        Raise heel of nearest foot off floor. Place far hand over other
        hand or interlace fingers.
      Execution

      Keeping arms straight, pull stirrup diagonally downward around
        shoulders by rotating torso and gradually lowering arms downward
        until cable is just above shoulder. Gradually bend knees as stirrup
        makes its way around body and approaches bottom. Return to original
        position and repeat. Continue with opposite side.
      Comments

      Both arms should be straight following diagonal path downward.
        This movement arguably involves more hip internal
        rotation and transverse
        adduction than spinal
        rotation. Although it is considered oblique movement, remarkably
        little rotation actually occurs through spine although rotators
        of spine act largely as stabilizers except at very beginning
        and end of motion were resistance from cable is minimal. A large
        part of rotational force actually occurs through rotation/transverse
        adduction of forward hip. Because rear leg is only supported
        by forefoot, hip of forward leg is utilized much greater than
        hip of rear leg since forward leg offers more secure base of
        support. Continued rotation would occur through spine except
        cable would make contact with body precluding further movement
        and resistance would no longer be provided through cable since
        line of force
        is no longer perpendicular line of pull. Seated oblique exercises,
        or those exercises where hips are stabilized allow for greater
        range of movement through spine. See Spot
        Reduction Myth.

Title: Cable Twist (down up)
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: Obliques

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Grasp stirrup from low cable pulley. Turn to one side away
        from pulley. Position feet wide apart with furthest foot away
        from pulley and nearest foot close to pulley. Point both feet
        away from pulley. Raise heel of nearest foot off floor. Bend
        knees of both legs slightly. Place far hand over other hand or
        interlace fingers.
      Execution

      Keeping arms straight, pull stirrup diagonally upward around
        shoulders by rotating torso and raising arms gradually upward
        until cable makes contact with side of body. Bend knees slightly
        more as stirrup approaches top. Return to original position and
        repeat. Continue with opposite side.
      Comments

      Both arms should be straight following diagonal path upward.
        Both arms should be horizontal and straight. This movement arguably
        involves more hip internal
        rotation and transverse
        adduction than spinal
        rotation. Although it is considered oblique movement, remarkably
        little rotation actually occurs through spine although rotators
        of spine act largely as stabilizers except at very beginning
        and end of motion were resistance from cable is minimal. A large
        part of rotational force actually occurs through rotation/transverse
        adduction of forward hip. Because rear leg is only supported
        by forefoot, hip of forward leg is utilized much greater than
        hip of rear leg since forward leg offers more secure base of
        support. Continued rotation would occur through spine except
        cable makes contact with body precluding further movement and
        resistance would no longer be provided through cable since line of force is
        no longer perpendicular line of pull. Seated oblique exercises,
        or those exercises where hips are stabilized allow for greater
        range of movement through spine. See Spot
        Reduction Myth.

Title: Cable Upright Shoulder External Rotation
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: Infraspinatus

Instructions:

    
    
    

    Instructions

    Preparation

    Stand facing low to medium height cable pulley. Grasp stirrup
      attachment and position bent elbow shoulder height out to side
      with forearm in line with cable.
    Execution

    Pull stirrup up and back as far as possible. Return by lowering
      stirrup to original position. Repeat. Continue with opposite
      arm.
    Comments

    Wrist may be keep straighter throughout movement than what
      is shown. Also, keep elbow at shoulder height and bent at right
      angle. Height of cable pulley is dependent upon:
    Individual range of motion
      shoulder
        internal and external
        rotation
        also see Flexibility Assessments
        For example, pulley cable can be lowered if exerciser has
        adequate shoulder internal rotation.
      Desired emphasis of resistance near specific range of motion.
    Greatest relative resistance is at range of motion where
      cable is perpendicular to forearm.
      Low pulley is hardest at beginning.
        Pulley at height of elbow is hardest at end.

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Grasp stirrup from shoulder height cable pulley with both
        hands. Step and turn lower body away from pulley until near arm
        is horizontal and straight. Position feet wide apart facing away

Title: Cable Standing Twisting Crunch (single side)
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: Obliques

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Position back against back pad with knees slightly bent,
        shoulders back, and chest high. Place cable straps over shoulder.
        Hold against front of body with opposite hand so that cable is
        taunt. If available, place hand in rope slot that allows cable
        to be taut when hand is in position with shoulders back.
      Execution

      Flex and twist spine so shoulder pulls strap diagonally forward
        and downward away from pulley. Return until back of shoulder
        returns to back pad and repeat.
      Comments

      To allow for full range of motion, grip height on strap should
        not allow weight to bottom out (weights touching stack) when
        shoulders are back. Padded hump should be adjusted to height
        of low back. See Spot

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Stand with feet together and hands just in front of thighs.
        Lift leg slightly so foot is just off floor.
      Execution

      Lower torso forward and downward while raising lifted leg
        back behind. Keep back straight and knee of supporting leg slightly
        bend. Keep hip and knee of lifted leg extended throughout movement.
        Once stretch is felt or hands contact floor, return to original
        position by raising torso while lowering lifted leg. Straighten
        knee of supporting leg as torso becomes upright. Repeat.
      Comments

      Throughout lift keep arms and back straight. Do not lower
        weight beyond mild stretch throughout hamstrings. Full range
        of motion will vary from person to person. Those with less
        flexibility may need to bend knee of supporting leg more
        so hands can come closer to floor. At top of movement, lifted
        foot can make contact with floor to maintain balance between

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Kneel below high pulley. Grasp cable rope attachment with
        both hands. Place wrists against head. Position hips back and
        flex hips allowing resistance on cable pulley to lift torso upward
        so spine is hyperextended.
      Execution

      With hips stationary, flex waist to one side so elbow travels
        toward mid-thigh on opposite side. Return to original position
        and repeat on opposite side. Continue by alternating between
        sides.
      Comments

      Note movement occurs in waist, not hips. See Spot
        Reduction Myth. Hyperextension of spine at top of motion
        is achived by anterior rotation of pelvis with flexed hips. Certain
        individuals may need to keep their neck in neutral position with
        space between their chin and sternum. If two soft stirrups are
        used instead of rope attachment, grasp stirrups at side of head.

Title: Front Plank
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: RectusAbdominis

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Lie prone on mat. Place forearms on mat, elbows under shoulders.
        Place legs together with forefeet on floor.
      Execution

      Raise body upward by straightening body in straight line.
        Hold position.
      Comments

      Muscles are exercised isometrically.
        Exercise can also be performed with straight supporting arms
        in pushup stance. Also see Spot
        Reduction Myth.
      Easier

      Movement can be made easier angling body up on elevated platform
        or bench. Exercise can also be performed on bent knees instead
        of forefeet.
      Harder

      Exercise could be made more challenging with added weight
        (eg: sandbags, partner) on hips or low back although it is rarely
        performed in that manner. Raising one foot up off floor can also
        make holding this position more difficult. Stability
        Ball Rollout requires more shoulder strength.

Title: Suspended Pull Through
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: RectusAbdominis

Instructions:

    
    
    

    Instructions

    Preparation

    Sit on floor with feet under suspension trainer loops in
      low position. Reach and grasp bottom of loops and lay back supine.
      Raise legs and place heels in loops with soles contacting handles
      (or ankles through loops as shown). Extend legs out straight.
      Sit up and place hands on floor to sides at desired distance
      from suspension trainer. Raise hips from floor supporting upper
      body with arms.
    Execution

    Pull hips back while flexing spine in C shape. Raise hips
      up high by straightening spine and hips until straight.
    Comments

    Abdominals are exercised during spinal flexion, whereas,
      Erector Spinae is exercised during spinal extension. See Spot Reduction
      Myth and Lower
      Ab Myth.
    Easier

    Movement can be made easier for Abdominals, yet harder for
      Erector Spinae by positioning body closer under anchor of suspension
      trainer.
    Harder

    Movement can be made harder for Abdominals, yet easier for
      Erector Spinae by positioning body further back, away horizontally
      from anchor of suspension trainer.

        ball with shoulders and head hanging off and knees and hips bent.
        Gently hyperextend back on contour of ball. Cross arms on chest.
      Execution

      Flex waist to raise upper torso. Return to original position.
        Repeat.
      Comments

      Some individuals may experience low back discomfort if hips
        are not bent so they must use smaller ball
        size or lower their hip position on ball. See Spot
        Reduction Myth.
      Easier

      Movement can be made easier by positioning hips low on ball
        or placing arms further down to sides of waist. See Arm
        Position During Waist Exercises.
      Harder

      Exercise can be made more challenging by using positioning
        ball lower on back and hips higher or placing hands behind neck
        or beside head.

Title: Sled Rear Lunge
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: GluteusMaximus

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Position shoulders under padded bars handles. Place feet
        under bar or just slight forward. Straighten legs so weight is
        lifted. Disengage dock lever(s) if available. Place feet slightly
        forward.
      Execution

      Step back with one leg while bending supporting leg. Plant
        forefoot far back on floor. Lower body by flexing knee and hip
        of supporting leg until knee of rear leg is almost in contact
        with floor. Return to original standing position by extending
        hip and knee of forward supporting leg and return rear leg next
        to supporting leg. Repeat movement with opposite legs alternating
        between sides.
      Comments

      If available reengage dock lever(s) in extended position
        before dismounting. Keep torso upright during lunge; flexible
        hip flexors are important. Forward knee should point same
        direction as foot throughout lunge. A long lunge with feet slighly
        forward emphasizes Gluteus Maximus; short lunge with feet under
        the bar emphasizes Quadriceps.

Title: Cable Twisting Standing Overhead Pull
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: LatissimusDorsi

Instructions:

    
    
    

    Instructions

    Preparation

    Stand facing very high pulley. Grasp stirrup in one hand
      and step back so arm is straight. With leg of opposite side as
      loaded arm, plant forefoot far back on floor. Slightly bend knee
      of forward leg, same direction
      as foot.
    Execution

    Pull down cable attachment to side of chest and rotate body
      toward side of pulling arm. Return until arm and shoulder is
      fully extended allowing shoulder to raise. Repeat. Continue with
      opposite arm.
    Comments

    In standing position, both spinal rotation and hip rotation
      contribute to body's rotation. Because rear leg is only supported
      by forefoot, hip of forward leg is utilized (hip internal
      rotation / transverse
      adduction) much greater than hip of rear leg since forward
      leg offers more secure base of support.
    Opposite Stance

    With the legs in opposite
      stance, body will be turned more away from cable resulting
      in slight difference of muscle involvement throughout movement.
    
      During movement:
    

    less spinal
        rotation
        more hip external
        rotators / transverse
        abduction (forward/opposite side hip)
        less hip internal
        rotators / transverse
        adduction (rear/same side hip)
      
      Near end of pull:
    

    less shoulder
        extension
        more shoulder
        transverse extension

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Lie upper back perpendicular on bench. Flex hips slightly
        so hips are slightly lower than torso. Grasp revolving barbell
        cable attachment from behind. Pull to position cable attachment
        over chest. Fix elbows with small bend.
      Execution

      Lower cable attachment toward pulley with elbows bent only
        slightly. Lower until shoulders are fully flexed or upper arms
        are in-line with upper torso. Raise cable attachment over head
        and continue toward lower body until cable becomes very close
        to head. repeat.
      Comments

      Lower body extending off of bench acts as counter balance
        to resistance and keeps upper back fixed on bench. Avoid hips
        from raising up significantly. Actual range of motion is dependent
        upon individual shoulder flexibility. Keep elbows fixed at small
        bend throughout exercise.

Instructions:

    
    
    

    Instructions

    Preparation

    Grasp handles and step forward between suspension trainer.
      Position arms downward and slightly forward, nearly parallel
      with suspension straps. Lean forward placing upper body weight
      onto handles with arms straight, while stepping back onto forefeet,
      so body is leaning forward at desired angle. Straighten body
      so torso is inline with legs. Bend elbows slightly and internally
      rotate shoulders, so elbows are pointed outward to each side.
    Execution

    Lower body by allowing suspension handles to separate outward
      until mild stretch is felt in chest. Reverse motion by bringing
      handles back together in hugging motion. Repeat.
    Comments

    Throughout movement, keep elbows in fixed, slightly bent
      position and shoulders internally rotated, so elbows are kept
      pointed outward and high. Arms and suspension straps plane of
      motion should be perpendicular with body. Both upper and lower
      body must be kept straight throughout movement. Angle of body
      affects difficulty of movement. See Gravity
      Vectors for greater understanding of body angle influences
      resistance. Also known as Suspended Chest Fly. See front
      angled view.
    Easier

    Resistance is least when body is positioned upright, at top
      of exercise. Movement can also be made easier with staggered
      foot position by placing one foot slightly forward. Elbows can
      also become slightly more bent as arms extend further out to
      sides.
    Harder

    This movement can be made more challenging by positioning
      body more horizontal at lower position. This can be achieved
      by placing feet further back and having handles positioned further
      down nearer ground. Elbows can be kept somewhat straighter, particularly
      as arms extend further out to sides.

    Instructions

    Preparation

    Straddle seat with both levers positioned slightly above
      horizontal. Grasp both lever ends with elbows slightly above
      levers. Sit down near end of seat with torso leaning forward
      slightly and slightly bent elbows pointing back.
    Execution

    Push levers downward and together in hugging motion. Keep
      shoulders internally rotated so elbows are pointed slightly upward
      at top and out to sides at bottom. Return to starting position
      until chest muscles are stretched. Repeat.
    Comments

    Under greater resistance, positioning torso at lower angle
      downward (by bending over at hips), will allow upper body weight
      to counterbalance upward pull of cables, as opposed to stepping
      forward and struggling with the backward pull of cables. Also

Title: Weighted Twisting Crunch (on stability ball)
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: Obliques

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Sit on exercise ball. Walk forward on ball and lie back on
        ball with shoulders and head hanging off and knees and hips bent.
        Gently hyperextend back to contour of ball. Hold plate behind
        neck or on chest with both hands or use no weight.
      Execution

      Flex waist to raise upper torso. Return to original position
        and repeat.
      Comments

      Weight can be held behind neck. Certain individuals may need
        to keep their neck in neutral position with space between their
        chin and sternum. Exercise can be performed without
        added weight until more resistance is needed. Movement can
        be made easier by positioning hips low on ball. In contrast,
        exercise can be made more challenging by positioning ball lower
        on back and hips higher. Some individuals may experience low
        back discomfort if hips are not bent so they must use smaller
        ball size
        or lower their hip position on ball. See Arm

Title: Cable Standing Twisting Crunch
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: Obliques

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Position back against back pad with knees slightly bent,
        shoulders back, and chest high. Place both cable straps over
        shoulders, one in each hand. Place hands with cable strap in
        front of each shoulder so that cable is taunt. If available,
        place hands in strap slots that allow cable to be taut when hands
        are in position with shoulders back.
      Execution

      Flex and twist spine so torso pulls strap forward and downward
        while twisting one shoulder to forward center. Return until back
        of shoulders return to back pad. Repeat alternating twists with
        opposite sides.
      Comments

      To allow for full range of motion, grip height on strap should
        not allow weight to bottom out (weights touching stack) when
        shoulders are back. Padded hump should be adjusted to height
        of low back. See Spot

        back of shoulders contact padded incline board. Repeat.
      Comments

      Exercise can be performed without
        added weight until more resistance is needed. Elevate incline
        to increase resistance. See Arm
        Position During Waist Exercises. If no knee support is built
        in to incline board, ball can be placed under legs as illustrated.
        Hip and knee flexors may be involved as stabilizers if incline
        is steep and no calf support is used. See advanced

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Sit on exercise ball with medicine ball in hands. Walk forward
        on ball and lie back on ball with shoulders and head hanging
        off and knees and hips bent. Gently hyperextend back to contour
        of ball. Position medicine ball over upper chest with arms extended.
      Execution

      Keeping arms extended and medicine ball over upper chest,
        flex waist to raise upper torso. Return to original position.
        Repeat.
      Comments

      If ball is positioned lower than upper chest (eg: over waist),
        effective resistance dramatically diminishes. See how length
        of lever arm effects resistance. Movement can be made easier
        by positioning hips low on ball. In contrast, exercise can be
        made more challenging by using positioning ball lower on back
        and hips higher. Some individuals may experience low back discomfort
        if hips are not bent so they must use smaller ball
        size or lower their hip position on ball. See Arm

Instructions:

    
    
    

    Instructions

    Preparation

    Step up onto platform. Position belly on wide pad, forearms
      on padded arm rest, and grip handles. Position bottom of foot
      on foot lever with lower leg under pad.
    Execution

    Push foot lever back by extending hip. Return leg to original
      position. Repeat. Reposition and continue with opposite leg.
    Comments

    Despite apperatus' similarity to rear kick exercise, it is
      actually hip extension exercise due to the isolated hip movement
      which is apperent with lack
      of knee articulation.

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Sit in machine with chest against pad. Grasp parallel handles
        from inside with thumbs down at shoulder height.
      Execution

      Keeping elbows pointed high, pull handles apart and to rear
        until elbows are just behind back. Return and repeat.
      Comments

      Pronated grip will internally rotate shoulders so elbows
        are kept at height of shoulders.
        Preventing elbows from dropping below shoulders will minimize
        Latissimus Dorsi
        involvement. With thumbs down
        grip, shoulder must be deliberately internally rotated to
        keep elbow at proper height. Some machines allow for a more neutral
        overhand grip.

Title: Cable Twisting Standing High Row
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: BackGeneral

Instructions:

    
    
    

    Instructions

    Preparation

    Stand facing high pulley positioned slightly above head level.
      Grasp stirrup in one hand and step back so arm is straight. With
      leg of opposite side as loaded arm, plant forefoot far back on
      floor. Slightly bend knee of forward leg, same direction as foot.
      Allow shoulder with stirrup to be pulled forward with twist through
      waist.
    Execution

    Pull cable attachment to side of torso and
      rotate body toward side of pulling arm. Pull shoulder back and
      push chest forward. Return until arm is extended and shoulder
      is pulled forward. Repeat. Continue with opposite arm.
    Comments

    In standing position, both spinal rotation and hip rotation
      contribute to body's rotation. Because rear leg is only supported
      by forefoot, hip of forward leg is utilized (hip internal
      rotation / transverse
      adduction) much greater than hip of rear leg since forward
      leg offers more secure base of support.
    Opposite Stance

    With the legs in opposite stance, body will be turned more
      away from cable resulting in slight difference of muscle involvement
      throughout movement.
    
      During movement:
    

    less spinal
        rotation
        more hip external
        rotators / transverse
        abduction (forward/opposite side hip)
        less hip internal
        rotators / transverse
        adduction (rear/same side hip)
      
      Near end of pull:
    

    less shoulder
        extension
        more shoulder
        abduction

Title: Lever Bent-over Fly (on
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: PectoralSternal

Instructions:

    
    
    

    Instructions

    Preparation

    Stand on platform in front of Lever Iron Cross Machine. Grasp
      handles to each side. Bend over at hips with knees and elbows
      bent slightly. Internally rotate shoulders so elbows are pointing
      upward.
    Execution

    Bring lever handles together in hugging motion with elbows
      in fixed position. Keep shoulders internally rotated so elbows
      are pointed upward at top and out to sides at bottom. Return
      to starting position until chest muscles are stretched. Repeat.
    Comments

    Height of platform should allow shoulders to be near the
      same height of fulcrums. Secondary
      levers compensate somewhat for variations if alignment between
      points of rotation (lever fulcrum and shoulder girdle articulation).
      Under greater resistance, height of platform can be increased
      so torso can be positioned at lower angle downward (by bending
      over at hips). This will allow upper body weight to counterbalance
      upward pull of levers. See Lever
      Seated Iron Cross Fly and Lever
      Iron Cross for Lats.

Title: Cable Bar Standing Decline Chest Press
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: PectoralSternal

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Stand facing behind cable bar, mounted on each side to shoulder
        height narrow double pulley cables. Grasp cable bar with wide
        over hand grip. Position bar lower mid-chest height with elbows
        angled behind and above. Lean and step forward with one foot
        in front, bending forward knee.
      Execution

      Push cable bar forward and downward until bar is about hip
        height and arms are straight. Return cable bar to original position
        until slight stretch is felt in chest or shoulders. Repeat.
      Comments

      Cable pulleys should be relatively close together, narrower
        than width of arms extended out to sides (but not too close),
        closer than what is typically found on standard cable cross over
        setup.

Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: PectoralSternal

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Stand between two high pulleys, facing away from cable columns.
        Grasp cable stirrups from each side. Position stirrups down to
        sides of lower chest with elbows high out to sides. Angle forearms
        downward with hands elbow width or slightly narrower. Lean and
        step forward with forward
        leg bent or stand feet side by side with both legs slightly
        bent (as shown).
      Execution

      Push stirrups at forward/downward angle until arms are straight
        and parallel to one another. Return stirrups to original position
        until slight stretch is felt in chest or shoulders. Repeat.
      Comments

      Stirrup should follow slight arch pattern as hands travel
        closer together toward extension. Cable pulleys should be relatively
        close together, narrower than width of arms extended out to sides
        (but not too close), closer than what is typically found on standard
        cable cross over setup.

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      With dumbbells in each hand, position feet under foot pad
        and lie supine on steep incline bench. Position dumbbells straight
        over shoulders.
      Execution

      Flex waist to raise upper torso from bench, keeping low back
        on bench. Return until back of shoulders contact padded incline
        bench. Repeat.
      Comments

      Keep weight above shoulders throughout movement. A standard
        incline crunch without additional weight should be performed
        until greater resistance is required. Incline bench shown is
        designed for chest exercises, not abdominal exercise. Flexible
        hip flexors are required if bench does not provide for fixed
        hip flexion. A relatively steep incline is required to adequately
        position abdominal against load throughout fuller range of motion.

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Stand below high pulley. Grasp multi-exercise bar cable attachment
        with parallel grip. Position hands near sides head. Squat down
        slightly with hips flexed, allowing resistance on cable pulley
        to lift torso upward so spine is hyperextended.

      With knees and hips stationary, flex waist so elbows travel
        toward middle of thighs. Return and repeat.
      Comments

      Note movement occurs in waist, not hips. Hyperextension of
        spine at top of motion is achived by anterior rotation of pelvis
        with flexed hips. See Spot

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Position back against back pad with knees slightly bent,
        shoulders back, and chest high. Position both cable ropes over
        shoulders, one in each hand. Place hands with cable ropes in
        front of each shoulder so that cable is taunt. If available,
        place hand in rope slot that allows cable to be taut when hands
        are in position.
      Execution

      Flex waist so torso pulls ropes forward and downward. Return
        until back of shoulders return to surface. Repeat alternating
        twists with opposite sides.

Title: Cable Kneeling Crunch
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: RectusAbdominis

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Kneel below high pulley. Grasp cable rope attachment with
        both hands. Place wrists against head. Position hips back and
        flex hips allowing resistance on cable pulley to lift torso upward
        so spine is hyperextended.
      Execution

      With hips stationary, flex waist so elbows travel toward
        middle of thighs. Return and repeat.
      Comments

      Note movement occurs in waist, not hips. See Spot
        Reduction Myth. Hyperextension of spine at top of motion
        is achived by anterior rotation of pelvis with flexed hips. Certain
        individuals may need to keep their neck in neutral position with
        space between their chin and sternum. If two soft stirrups are
        used instead of rope attachment, grasp stirrups at side of head.
        Also see alternative
        technique. Movement can also be performed standing up, see
        Cable Standing Overhead
        Crunch.

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Seat on stability ball against low pulley column. Roll back
        away from low pulley column so back is on ball. Reach back and
        grasp cable rope attachment with both hands and place inside
        of wrists on sides of head. Allow weight to hyperextend lower
        back against stability ball.
      Execution

      With hips stationary, flex waist so elbows travel toward
        thighs. Return and repeat.
      Comments

      See Spot
        Reduction Myth. Certain individuals may need to keep their
        neck in neutral position with space between their chin and sternum.
        Some individuals may experience low back discomfort if hips are
        not bent so they must use smaller ball
        size or lower their hip position on ball.

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Stand between lever handles with shoulder width or narrower
        stance. Squat down and grasp handles to each side. Stand upright
        with arms straight down to sides.
      Execution

      With back straight, bow forward by bending hips and bend
        knees slightly during descent. Raise torso by extending hips
        while gradually extending knees until standing upright. Pull
        shoulders back slightly if rounded. Repeat.
      Comments

      Do not stand behind handles. Throughout lift keep arms and
        back straight. Do not lower weight beyond mild stretch throughout
        hamstrings. When finished with set, dismount by lowering weight
        with knees bent and low back straight. Full range of motion will
        vary from person to person. Those with less
        flexibility may have to bend knees more. Knees can be kept
        bent throughout movement.

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Hold dumbbell in each hand. Position dumbbells down in front
        of upper thighs with arms straight. Stand with feet together.
        Lift leg slightly so foot is just off floor.
      Execution

      Lower dumbells to floor while raising lifted leg back behind.
        Keep back straight and knee of supporting leg slightly bend.
        Keep hip and knee of lifted leg extended throughout movement.
        Once stretch is felt or dumbells contacts floor, return to original
        position by raising torso while lowering lifted leg. Straighten
        knee of supporting leg as torso becomes upright. Repeat.
      Comments

      Throughout lift keep arms and back straight. Do not lower
        weight beyond mild stretch throughout hamstrings. Full range
        of motion will vary from person to person. Those with less
        flexibility may need to bend knee of supporting leg more
        so dumbells can come closer to floor. At top of movement, lifted
        foot can make contact with floor to maintain balance between
        repetitions.

      Comments

      Keep torso upright during lunge; flexible
        hip flexors are important. Lead knee should point same direction
        as foot throughout lunge. A long lunge emphasizes Gluteus Maximus;
        short lunge emphasizes Quadriceps.

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Stand with dumbbells grasped to sides.
      Execution

      Step back with one leg while bending supporting leg. Plant
        forefoot far back on floor. Lower body by flexing knee and hip
        of supporting leg until knee of rear leg is almost in contact
        with floor. Return to original standing position by extending
        hip and knee of forward supporting leg and return rear leg next
        to supporting leg. Repeat movement with opposite legs alternating
        between sides.

Title: Cable Straight-back Stiff-leg Deadlift
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: GluteusMaximus

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Stand between two very low pulleys with shoulder width or
        narrower stance. Squat down and grasp stirrup attachments to
        each side. Stand upright with arms straight down to sides.
      Execution

      With back straight, bow forward by bending hips and bend
        knees slightly during descent. Raise torso by extending hips
        while gradually extending knees until standing upright. Pull
        shoulders back slightly if rounded. Repeat.
      Comments

      Do not stand behind pulleys. Throughout lift keep arms and
        back straight. Do not lower weight beyond mild stretch throughout
        hamstrings. When finished with set, dismount by lowering weight
        with knees bent and low back straight. Full range of motion will
        vary from person to person. Those with less
        flexibility may have to bend knees more. Knees can be kept
        bent throughout movement. Also see Stiff
        Leg Deadlift.

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Stand with cable columns to each side. Grasp left stirrup
        with right hand and right stirrup with left hand. Bend knees
        and bend over at hips so torso is approximately horizontal with
        back straight. Point elbows outward with arms slightly bent.
      Execution

      Raise upper arms to sides until elbows are shoulder height.
        Maintain upper arms perpendicular to torso and slight bend in
        elbows as arms are raised to sides. Lower and repeat.
      Comments

      Upper arm should travel perpendicular to torso to minimize
        latissimus dorsi
        involvement. Elbows may bend slightly at bottom of movement (as
        shown) or they may be kept fixed. If low back can not be keep
        straight due to inflexibility
        of hamstrings, try keeping knees bent more.

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Sit slightly forward on bench or platform. Grasp stirrup
        cable attachment with one hand. Straighten lower back upright
        and slide hips back so knees are slightly bent.
      Execution

      Pull stirrup out to side, elbows up shoulder height until
        elbows travel slightly behind back. Allow wrist to follow elbow.
        Keep upper arm horizontal, perpendicular to trunk. Return until
        arm is extended and shoulder is stretched forward. Repeat.
      Comments

      The relatively powerful Latissimus
        Dorsi becomes involved:
      if upper arm travels closer than perpendicular to trunk
        if torso is positioned forward beyond vertical
      Elbow should be high approaching same height as shoulder.

Title: Suspended Y Lateral Raise
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: DeltoidLateral

Instructions:

    
    
    

    Instructions

    Preparation

    Grasp suspension handles and momentarily step back until
      arms are extended forward and straight. While keeping arms straight
      and shoulders back, step forward so body reclines back behind
      suspension handles. Position body and legs straight at desired
      angle hanging from handles with arms straight and palms angled
      inward.
    Execution

    Raise arms upward and outward in shape of a Y while keeping
      arms straight. Return and lower body back in opposite motion
      until arms are extended straight forward in original position.
      Repeat.
    Comments

    At higher angles, feet can be placed flat on floor. When
      angled further back, only heels may contact forefeet floor with
      forefeet raising upward. Dismounting can be achieved by walking
      backward until body is upright.
    Easier

    Resistance is least when body is positioned upright at top
      of exercise. Movement can be made easier with staggered
      foot position by placing one foot slightly back.
    Harder

    This movement can be made more challenging by placing feet
      more forward, thereby angling body
      back at initiation of movement. In which case, stance can be
      on heels with forefeet pointing upward. See Gravity
      Vector for greater understanding of how body angle influences
      resistance.

Instructions:

    
    
    

    Instructions

    Preparation

    Sit on curl machine. Grasp lever handles with underhand grip.
      Align elbows at same pivot point as fulcrum of lever while
      placing back of arms up on pads.
    Execution

    Pull one lever handle toward shoulder. Return handle until
      arm is fully extended. Repeat with opposite arm. Continue alternating
      movement between arms.
    Comments

    Back of upper arms should remaining on pad throughout movement.
      If machine has secondary lever (as shown), elbows can be positioned
      further away from primary fulcrum. Long head (lateral head) of
      biceps brachii is activated significantly more than short head
      (medial head) of biceps brachii since short head enters into
      active insufficiency
      as it continues to contract. Long head of Triceps Brachii is
      only significant activated as antagonist stabilizer when it approaches
      passive insufficiency
      as elbow nears full flexion. See
      exercise performed with both arms simultaneously.

Title: Cable Bar Standing Chest Press
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: PectoralSternal

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Stand facing behind cable bar, mounted on each side to shoulder
        height narrow double pulley cables. Grasp cable bar with wide
        over hand grip. Position bar mid-chest height with elbows angled
        behind. Lean and step forward with one foot in front, bending
        forward leg.
      Execution

      Push cable bar forward until arms are straight. Return cable
        bar to original position until slight stretch is felt in chest
        or shoulders. Repeat.
      Comments

      Cable pulleys should be relatively close together, narrower
        than width of arms extended out to sides (but not too close),
        closer than what is typically found on standard cable cross over
        setup. Range of motion will be compromised if grip is too
        wide.

Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: PectoralSternal

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Stand between two shoulder height pulleys, facing away from
        cable columns. Grasp cable stirrups from each side. Position
        stirrups to sides of chest with elbows high out to sides. Position
        forearms horizontal and parallel with hands elbow width. Step
        forward in lunging posture (one foot in front and other foot
        behind). Lean and step forward with one foot in front, bending
        forward leg.
      Execution

      Push stirrups forward until arms are straight and parallel
        to one another. Return stirrups to original position until slight
        stretch is felt in chest or shoulders. Repeat.
      Comments

      Stirrup should follow slight arch pattern as hands travel
        closer together toward extension. Cable pulleys should be relatively
        close together, narrower than width of arms extended out to sides
        (but not too close), closer than what is typically found on standard

Title: Cable Standing Fly
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: PectoralSternal

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Grasp two opposing high pulley dumbbell attachments. Stand
        with pulleys to each side. Bend over slightly by flexing hips
        and knees. Bend elbows slightly and internally rotate shoulders
        so elbows are back initially.
      Execution

      Bring cable attachments together in hugging motion with elbows
        in fixed position. Keep shoulders internally rotated so elbows
        are pointed upward at top and out to sides at bottom. Return
        to starting position until chest muscles are stretched. Repeat.
      Comments

      Under greater resistance, positioning torso at lower angle
        downward (by bending over at hips), will allow upper body weight
        to counterbalance upward pull of cables, as opposed to stepping
        forward and struggling with the backward pull of cables.

Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: PectoralSternal

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Grasp two opposing high pulley dumbbell attachments. Lie
        supine on decline bench, in middle and perpendicular to both
        pulleys. Slightly bend elbows and internally rotate shoulders
        so elbows are back.
      Execution

      Bring cable stirrups together above upper abdomen in hugging
        motion; elbows in fixed position and shoulders internally rotated
        so elbows are to sides. Return to starting position until chest
        is slightly stretched. Repeat.
      Comments

      Since incline of bench does not actually effect angle of
        pull as with dumbbells, similar effect can be achieved on flat
        bench if cable stirrups are brought together above upper abdomen
        instead of chest.

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Position feet under foot pad and lie supine on steep incline
        bench. Pull barbell from floor or grasp from rack behind with
        overhand grip. Position barbell over chest with shoulder width
        or slightly wider grip.
      Execution

      Flex waist to raise upper torso from bench, keeping low back
        on bench. Return until back of shoulders contact padded incline
        board. Repeat.
      Comments

      Keep weight above shoulders throughout movement. A standard
        incline crunch without additional weight should be performed
        until greater resistance is required. Incline bench shown is
        designed for chest exercises, not abdominal exercise. Flexible
        hip flexors are required if bench does not provide for fixed
        hip flexion. A relatively steep incline is required to adequately
        position abdominal against load throughout fuller range of motion.

        almost in contact with lower platform. Return to original standing
        position by extending hip and knee of forward leg. Repeat by
        alternating rear lunge with opposite leg.
      Comments

      Keep torso upright during lunge; flexible
        hip flexors are important. Forward knee should point same
        direction as foot throughout lunge. A long lunge emphasizes Gluteus
        Maximus; short lunge emphasizes Quadriceps.

Title: Trap Bar Straight-back Stiff-leg Deadlift
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: GluteusMaximus

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Stand with feet shoulder width or narrower in trap bar, weight
        to each side. Squat down with feet flat and grasp handles to
        sides. Deadlift from floor.
      Execution

      With back straight, lower bar toward floor by bending at
        hips. Bend knees slightly during descent and keep waist straight.
        Place weight onto floor. With knees still bent, lift bar by extending
        at hips until standing upright. Pull shoulders back if rounded.
        Extend knees at top if desired. Repeat.
      Comments

      Not all trap bar designs may allow for this movement. A squared
        open-ended trap bar is used in this demonstration. Throughout
        lift keep arms and back straight. Do not lower weight beyond
        mild stretch throughout hamstrings. Full range of motion will
        vary from person to person. Those with less
        flexibility may have to bend knees more. Knees can be kept
        bent throughout movement.

Title: Barbell Hack Squat
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: GluteusMaximus

Instructions:

    
    
    

    Instructions

    Preparation

    Position barbell just behind legs. With feet flat on floor,
      squat down and grasp barbell from behind with overhand grip.
    Execution

    Lift bar by extending hips and knees to full extension. Squat
      down by bending knees forward
      while allowing hips to bend back behind, keeping back straight
      and knees pointed same direction as feet. Descend until thighs
      are close to parallel to floor and bar is behind lower leg. Repeat.
    Comments

    Throughout lift keep hips low, shoulders high, arms and back
      straight. Knees should point same direction as feet throughout
      movement. See flawed
      demonstration showing depth of hack squat that is NOT sufficient
      and knees are NOT pointed same angle as feet. Individuals with
      short arm to torso ratio or protracted
      shoulder posture, may find this exercise very difficult to
      perform. See Squat Analysis.

Title: Suspended Front Raise
Category: WeightExercises, Sub Category: DeltoidAnterior

Instructions:

    
    
    

    Instructions

    Preparation

    Grasp suspension handles and momentarily step back until
      arms are extended forward and straight. While keeping arms straight
      and shoulders back, step forward so body reclines back behind
      suspension handles.Position body and legs straight at desired
      angle hanging from handles with arms straight and palms facing
      downward.
    Execution

    Raise arms upward overhead by flexing shoulders with arms
      straight. Return and lower body back until arms are extended
      straight forward in original position. Repeat.
    Comments

    At higher angles, feet can be placed flat on floor. When
      angled further back, only heels may contact floor with forefeet
      raising upward. Dismounting can be achieved by walking backward
      until body is upright.
    Easier

    Resistance is least when body is positioned upright at top
      of exercise. Movement can be made easier with staggered
      foot position by placing one foot slightly back.
    Harder

    This movement can be made more challenging by placing feet
      more forward, thereby angling
      body back at initiation of movement. In which case, stance can
      be on heels with forefeet pointing upward. See Gravity
      Vector for greater understanding of how body angle influences
      resistance.

        arm toward low pulley. When elbow is fully flexed, it can travel
        forward slightly allowing forearms to be no more than vertical.
        This additional movement allows for relative release of tension
        in muscles between repetitions.

Instructions:

      
    
    

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Place small or folded cushioned mat on column or at end of
        wall approximately shoulder height. With hands supporting mat,
        stand with side toward mat. Step far to side so feet are away
        from wall or column forward. Place side of head on mat with shoulder
        extending over end of adjacent side of column or wall so body
        leans to side. Fold hands behind low back or hips.
      Execution

      Push side of head into mat and roll onto top of head moving
        body away from mat. Return to original position by rolling back
        down to side of head while bringing shoulder back over end of
        column or wall. Repeat.
      Comments

      Keep body somewhat straight allowing waist to bend outward
        away from mat slightly at end of lift. See all muscle used in
        Lateral Flexion:

        Movement of the Thoracic / Lumbar Spine is typical in this
        movement.

      Easier

      Begin with feet slightly closer to wall or column, so neck
        structures have an opportunity to adapt. Standard neck exercises
        with light weights can also be less intense.
      Weighted Lateral Neck Flexion
      Harder

      Movement is more challenging when feet are positioned further
        from column or wall.

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Grasp bar with shoulder width under hand grip.
      Execution

      Raise barbell straight up so elbows travel back as elbows

        horizontal position. Continue upward over chest until forearms
        are perpendicular. Lower until arms are fully extended. Repeat.
      Comments

      Bringing ebows back forward, allowing forearms to be no more
        than vertical, permits a relative release of tension in muscles
        between repetitions. Exercise can also be performed with EZ barbell,

      Instructions

      Preparation

      Grasp bar with shoulder width over hand grip.
      Execution

      With elbows to side, raise bar until forearms are vertical.
        Lower until arms are fully extended. Repeat.
      Comments

      When elbows are fully flexed, they can travel forward slightly
        allowing forearms to be no more than vertical. This additional
        movement allows for relative release of tension in muscles between
        repetitions.
